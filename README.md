# COMP 177-Project
Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

## Features
- **Display Network Topology**: Users may visualize the current network graph with nodes, edges, and their weights

- **Node Removal**: Users may select nodes to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Edge Removal**: Users may select specific edges to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Display Shortest Path**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest between **Source Node A** and **Destination Node H***. 

## Instructions to run code in terminal
The following steps are to be followed to run the project in terminal, whether the project has been cloned or downloaded.

1) **cd** to the project's directory

2) Excute: pip install -r requirements.txt

3) After the required Python libraries are installed, execute the command: python app.py

4) Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
