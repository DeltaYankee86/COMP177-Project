# COMP 177-Project
Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

## Features
- **Display Network Topology**: Users may visualize the current network graph with nodes, edges, and their weights

- **Node Removal**: Users may select nodes to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Edge Removal**: Users may select specific edges to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Display Shortest Path**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest between **Source Node A** and **Destination Node H**. 

## Instructions to run code in terminal
The following steps are to be followed to run the project in terminal, whether the project has been cloned or downloaded.

1) Once in terminal, **cd** to the project's directory

2) The project requires Python to run. To verify Python installation, enter the command:
python --version

If Python is no installed, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

3) Install Dependencies:
**cd** back to the project's directory then execute the commands to install the dependencies for the project: 
- pip install flask
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install networkx

4) Run the Application:
Execute the command:
python -m flask run

5) Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or in terminal, mouseover http://127.0.0.1:5000, hold CTRL and click on it.
- Press the Exit on the landing page or press CTRL + C to end program
