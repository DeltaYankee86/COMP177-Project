# COMP177-Project
Dynamic routing mechanism design in faulty network using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

## Features
- **Display Network Topology**: Users may visualize the current network graph with nodes, edges, and their weights

- **Node Removal**: Users may select nodes to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Edge Removal**: Users may select specific edges to be simulated for failure and modify the network.

- **Display Shortest Path**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest between **Source Node A** and **Destination Node H***.
